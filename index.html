        Rock climbing</h1>

    <h4> Rock climbing isn't just looking at rock and then deciding to climb it. There are many different styles, techniques, and types of rock to climb. Rock climbing can be a very dangerous sport. Many people die each year because they don't know enough about climbing, before they start to climb.
        With all of the different styles of climbing, one of those types is Traditional. A traditional rock climber is usually called a 'Trad climber'. As a Trad climber starts to ascend a piece of rock, that climber will place his own protection, nuts and hexes, to ensure his own safety. When the Trad climber comes to a crack or a rock spur, he will place his protection in it. One end of the rope is connected to the climber, with the other end of the rope connected to the belayer. As the climber moves upward the belayer feeds rope through the belaying device as needed for the climber. This type of climbing is usually not done your first time climbing, because it is somewhat dangerous. This is for the more intermediate/advanced climber.
        Another style of climbing is Sport Climbing. Sport Climbing is very similar to Traditional Climbing, except that the gear is somewhat different. The rope situation is the same as with Traditional, it's just that the protection is already in place as the form of bolts. Instead of using "nuts" the sport climber uses quick draws. A quick draw is a short sling with a carabineer on each end. Sport Climbing is mostly climbing on the face of a rock, and usually isn't a very long climb. Since the danger element, of not having to secure your own protection, is removed the Sport Climber can focus on technique and tougher moves.
        Bouldering is also a style of climbing. Bouldering is a type of climbing, which allows you to only be a few feet off of the ground. There is no rope involved in this type of climbing. Which means there is no form of protection. </h4>
